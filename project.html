                        IEC took up the challenge to design and fabricate custom
    
                        built AVG units for a remote pacific Island. The challenge
    
                        was mainly to design filters which would work with the
    
                        limited hydraulic gradient available at site. The inlet head
    
                        available to the filters was only 4.5 meter (0.45 kg/cm2(g)).</p>
    
                    <p>Our SEBAC units were re-designed and simulated to work
    
                        at a lower inlet head of only 4.5 meter. This is an industry
    
                        leading figure for low head gravity filtration process. The
    
                        filter’s primary duty was to remove suspended solids before
    
                        being fed to the households in the Island.Since the filters
    
                        were to be supplied for potable water end users the
    
                        internals of the filter were coated with 400 micron
    
                        of potable grade epoxy. The backwash piping
    
                        were stainless steel for long life. The 13 units of
    
                        capacities ranging from 50 m3/hour to
    
                        100 m3/hour were packaged for the long sea
    
                        journey consisting of three ship changes.</p>
    
                    <p>All 13 units were commissioned by the customer
    
                        using our detailed manuals and remote
    
                        installation support. This order is a landmark

                Neutralization system for an American 
                chemical company</h1>

            <p>IEC has designed, supplied and validated a 2250 kg/hour
                chlorine leak absorption system for a premium American
                chemicals company. The contract required IEC to conduct a

                trial run at site with actual leaked chlorine at this rate.</p>

            <p>The outlet concentration of the treated gases was less than

                0.1 PPM, well below the acceptable emission rate.The system
                featured our proprietary 2 stage scrubbing system controlled

                with a touch screen PLC. The primary stage is an ejector
                scrubber capable of entrainment and neutralization of large
                leaks. The second stage is a polishing tower capable of picking-up the fine strains of chlorine from the
                mixture of gases.

                The system is a 24x7 continuous operation with a system

                response time of less than 5 seconds. The blowers and pumps
                are VFD operated to ramp up during duty and ramp down during

                normal ventilation process.</p>

            <p>EC has recently executed a large order for twenty

                brine system produces sodium hypochlorite of

                systems ranged from 250 gram/hour up to 1000
                grams/hour.</p>


            <p> Common applications for these units are cooling
                water treatment in process plants, tube well
                disinfection, potable water treatment. Our systems
                come with high-efficiency electrolysers which
                perform at an efficiency much greater than the
                competition. As a result the power consumption in
                our systems is generally 15% lower than the
                competition for the same output. The units are built
                in-house and fully shop tested. The system design
                and reliability has been validated by 1000 hours of
